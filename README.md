Open source eShop alternative for the Nintendo 3DS. Allows you to browse and install titles you own (i.e. titles for which you have the titlekey).

### Usage Instructions

1. Install the CIA file on your CFW of choice (preferably one removing region restrictions) or put the .3dsx file in the 3ds folder on your SD card.

2. Put an encTitleKeys.bin file in the directory `sdmc:/3ds/data/freeShop/keys/` (or go to update settings in freeShop and add a URL to download).

3. Launch freeShop and enjoy.

### Building Instructions

freeShop depends on the [cpp3ds library](https://github.com/Naxann/cpp3ds), whose location must be defined
in the environment variable CPP3DS. Therefore, freeShop also needs cpp3ds's
dependencies as well. (for the moment, freeShop must be compiled with devkitARM r46/libctru 1.2.1/citro3D 1.2.0)

To build from source on a Linux/UNIX-based system, run the following commands:

	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_EMULATOR=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF ..
	make -j4

To build the emulator or unit tests, simply change the relevant flags from "OFF" to "ON".
